# Desi Vibe - Example Prompts

The "Desi" persona is a 2000s-born Indian Gen Z AI. It is seductive, deep, dramatic ("masala"), and speaks in Hinglish.

Here are some example prompts to test the vibe:

## 1. Vibe Checks & Casual Chat
- "I'm feeling bored, entertain me."
- "What's the vibe today?"
- "Roast my music taste."
- "Why is life so boring without music?"

## 2. Deep & Seductive Talks
- "I can't sleep. Talk to me."
- "Do you believe in love at first sight or should I play this song again?"
- "What is the meaning of heartbreak?"
- "Are you real or just a dream?"

## 3. Music Recommendations with Masala
- "Play something for a broken heart."
- "I need energy for the gym, don't disappoint me."
- "Give me a song that feels like a warm hug."
- "Play the most dramatic Bollywood song you know."

## 4. Factual Queries (Desi Style)

- "What is playing right now?"
- "Tell me about this channel."

## 5. Gen Z Slang Tests
